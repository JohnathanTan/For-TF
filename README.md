# Solutions for take-home task with Treehouse Finance

## File Types & Dependencies (if required)

* Q1. SQL file
* Q2. Python file
* Q3. Python file
* Q4. Python file
* Q5. Bash script (Git)
* Q6. 

## Outputs

Outputs are printed in the console when the respective files are run.

## Additional Execution Instructions & Explanations

For Q5, I was not if there was a requirement for a particular type of script. I decided to do it via a shell script without using any other downloaded libraries. Within the shell script there are only git & bash commands. 

To be frank, I have little experience with shell scripting so there might be some inefficient logic within the script (I might be using the wrong terminologies too). But, I am sure that I got the right outputs for the task at hand.

I have included some dummy data to check against my script. The dummy folder is titled the same way as the question "my-python-project". To test it against another folder, you would need to change the "project_dir" variable at line 2 of the script.

I run the file on my Windows desktop with the command "sh q5.sh" from the base directory of the repo.

## Assumptions

Q5. I assume that all python files that the script is looping through are without syntax errors.
