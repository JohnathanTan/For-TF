#### Final answer first
The total possible dates conditioned on formats a, b, c, d and without repetition is
	= 3,652,059 + 3,518,103 + 2,078,247 + 3,652,059
	= 12,900,468
	
#### Counting methodology 
Starting with the format a "YYYY/MM/DD":
	Each common (non-leap) year has 365 days.
	Eacn leap year has 365 + 1 = 366 days.
	
	In the format of "YYYY", there can at max (10^4 - 1) or simply 9999 configurations not counting 0000 as a year (i.e. the very first year is 0001).
	And from 0001 to 9999, there will be 2424 leap years. 
	
	Thus,
		Total possible dates for format a = 9999*365 + 2424 = 3,652,059

Moving on to format b "MM/DD/YYYY":
	*I assume that the backslash character is not part of a "date".
	The last 4 digits in format b, "YYYY", will have overlaps with the last 4 digits in format a, "MMDD".
	The number of possible overlaps will be 365 + 1 = 366.
	
	Likewise,
	The first 4 digits in format b, "MMDD", will have overlaps with the last 4 digits in format a, "YYYY".
	And, the number of possible overlaps will also be 365 + 1 = 366 in this case.
	
	Hence, given format a and without repetition, 
		Total possible dates for format b = 3,652,059 - 366*366 = 3,518,103

Moving on to format c "DD/MM/YYYY":
	The last 4 digits in format c, "YYYY", will have overlaps with the last 4 digits in format b, "YYYY".
	The number of possible overlaps will be 9999.
	
	The last 2 digits in format c, "DD", will have overlaps with the last 4 digits in format b, "MM".
	The number of possible overlaps will be 12 (12 months).
	
	Likewise,
	The 3rd and 4th digits in format c, "MM", will have overlaps with the 3rd and 4th digits in format b, "DD".
	The number of possible overlaps will be 12 (12 months).
	
	Hence, given format a, format b and without repetition, 
		Total possible dates for format c = 3,518,103 - 12*12*9999 = 2,078,247
		
	
Finally, with format d. "DD (Jan/Feb/Mar/Apr/May/Jun/Jul/Aug/Sept/Oct/Nov/Dec) YYYY",
	The count for this format is the same as the count for format a alone.
	We are able to count it that way because format d displays its months in the "MMM" configuration. 
	This is unique from the formats a, b and c which uses "MM" and thus there will be no overlaps.
	
	Hence, given format a, format b, format c and without repetition,
		Total possible dates = 9999*365 + 2424 = 3,652,059
